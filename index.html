      assistant in the

      building visualization tools. My research explore efficient methods to
      layout labels (annotations) of data points in charts. I contribute to
      existing research projects including
      <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/">Vega</a> and
      <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/">Vega-Lite</a>. Concurrently, I
