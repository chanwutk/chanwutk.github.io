  I worked in the <a href="https://idl.cs.washington.edu/">UW Interactive Data Lab</a> as a research assistant,
  mentored by Professor <a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jheer/">Jeffrey Heer</a>.
  I worked in <a href="https://www.docusign.com/">DocuSign</a> and <a href="https://octoml.ai/">OctoML</a> as a software engineering intern.
